# Problem to be Solved

The problem at hand is to develop a PHP app or WordPress plugin that assists website administrators in improving their SEO rankings. The administrator should be able to visualize how their web pages are linked to the home page, allowing them to manually identify areas for SEO optimization.

# Technical Specification

To solve the problem, I will create a WordPress plugin with the following key components and functionalities:

Backend Admin Page:

Develop a back-end admin page or settings page for WordPress, providing a login mechanism for the admin.
Implement a crawl trigger functionality for the admin to manually initiate a crawl and view the results.

## Crawl Functionality:

- Set up a scheduled task to run the crawl every hour, while also allowing the admin to trigger an immediate crawl.
- During each crawl:
- Delete previous crawl results if any exist.
- Remove the existing sitemap.html file if it is present.
- Start the crawl from the website's root URL (home page).
- Extract and store all internal hyperlinks temporarily in a database.
- Display the crawl results on the admin page.
- Save the home page's .php file as a .html file.
- Generate a sitemap.html file to present the results in a sitemap-like structure.

## Viewing and Error Handling:

Enable the admin to request and view the stored crawl results on the admin page.
Implement an error notification mechanism to display error messages if any issues occur during the crawling process.

## Front-End Functionality:

Allow visitors to access and view the generated sitemap.html page on the front-end.

#Technical Decisions and Rationale

## Backend Framework:

I will use WordPress, depending on the requirements and preferences.
I will leverage its existing infrastructure and utilize a settings page for the admin.

## Database:

I will use MySQL as the database to store the temporary crawl results.
This choice ensures data persistence and allows for efficient retrieval and display on the admin page.

## Crawling Strategy:

To simplify the implementation, I will limit the crawl to the home webpage rather than recursively crawling through all internal hyperlinks.
This decision reduces complexity and focuses on the specific goal of analyzing the home page's link structure for SEO improvement.

## Error Handling:

I will implement an error notification system to inform the admin of any errors encountered during the crawl process.
This approach improves the user experience and provides guidance on how to address the issues.
