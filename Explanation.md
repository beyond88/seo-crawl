As a developer, my approach to solving this problem would involve the following steps:

<strong>Understanding the Requirements:</strong> I would carefully read and comprehend the provided requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of the desired outcome and user story.

<strong>Choosing the Technology:</strong> Based on the requirements, I would consider whether to build a standalone PHP application or a WordPress plugin. If WordPress is preferred or already in use, I would leverage its framework and create a settings page for the plugin.

<strong>Planning the Architecture:</strong> I would plan the overall architecture of the application or plugin, identifying the key components and their interactions. This would involve defining the necessary backend admin page, crawl functionality, viewing capabilities, error handling, and front-end integration.

<strong>Backend Implementation:</strong> I would start by developing the backend admin page or settings page. This would include creating the necessary user authentication mechanism to ensure only administrators can access the functionality. I would also design the interface for triggering crawls and viewing the results.

<strong>Crawl Functionality:</strong> To implement the crawl functionality, I would set up scheduled tasks using a suitable method (e.g., cron jobs or WordPress scheduled events) to trigger the crawl every hour. Additionally, I would provide an option for the admin to manually trigger an immediate crawl. During each crawl, I would handle tasks such as deleting previous crawl results, extracting internal hyperlinks, storing results temporarily in the database, and generating the sitemap.html file.

<strong>Viewing and Error Handling:</strong> I would implement the functionality to allow the admin to request and view the stored crawl results on the admin page. If any errors occur during the crawling process, I would display error notices to inform the admin of the issues and provide guidance on how to proceed.

<strong>Front-End Integration:</strong> On the front-end, I would enable visitors to access and view the generated sitemap.html page. This would involve ensuring the necessary routing and serving of the HTML file, making it easily accessible for SEO analysis.

<strong>Testing and Quality Assurance:</strong> Throughout the development process, I would perform rigorous testing to ensure the code functions as expected. This would involve both manual testing, simulating various scenarios, and automated testing using unit and integration tests. I would also consider utilizing tools like phpcs for code inspection and integrate the project with Travis CI for continuous integration.

<strong>Documentation and Deployment:</strong> Finally, I would thoroughly document the codebase, providing clear instructions for installation, configuration, and usage. Once everything is well-tested and documented, I would prepare the application or plugin for deployment, adhering to best practices and considering any specific requirements for packaging and distribution.

By following this approach, I would ensure a systematic and structured development process, addressing the problem step-by-step while considering technical decisions, best practices, and the desired outcome outlined in the user story.
